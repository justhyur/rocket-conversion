          <p>In the past years, I&apos;ve learned that most eCom-killing mistakes boil down to the basics.</p>
          <p>Making these mistakes your business is not going to reach its full potential in terms of sales and profits.</p>
          <p>Far from it, in fact.</p>
          <p>After analysing dozens of online stores I&apos;ve noticed that <strong>almost ALL of them</strong> are making the same 3 conversion killing mistakes.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s a crazy thing:</p>
          <p>Almost every store I&apos;ve audited recently seemed to be facing the exact same problem:</p>
          <p><strong>A steady increase in customer acquisition costs</strong></p>
          <p>All of these store owners (or their teams) were spending hundreds 
            of hours every month optimizing their ad campaigns... 
            yet every single year — without fail! — it&apos;s been getting more 
            and more expensive to convert website visitors into buyers.</p>
